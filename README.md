# Atari-Breakout
A variation of Atari Breakout Android Game

Your assignment is to write a relatively simple game, a variation on a popular Atari game called Breakout.  It works like this: Bounce a ball off a paddle to break bricks at the top of the screen.  The score could be the time it takes to break all of the bricks, or you could be scored on how many bricks you break before losing three lives. (Losing a life means missing the ball with the paddle.)  There are several variations on this.  Some require breaking all of the bricks, some just breaking through the wall.  In some variations, different colored bricks require different numbers of hits to break, and so on.  You will use the touchscreen to move the paddle.  Obviously you must pay close attention to the userâ€™s experience of the game.  Modify the high-score app you wrote to track scores in the game.  Keep a maximum of 10 high scores.

Consider that for the bricks, you will need to use the width of your screen to calculate how many there are and where they go.  Usually the game has three layers of bricks at the top.

Optionally, you can use a sensor, such as the accelerometer, to affect game play.  You get to define what this does, but it could change the angle of the ball slightly.
